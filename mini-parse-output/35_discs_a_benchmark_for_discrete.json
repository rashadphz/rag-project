In particular, DISCS consists of three groups of tasks: sampling from classical graphical models, sampling for solving combinatorial optimization problems, and sampling from deep EBMs. These tasks cover the topics of simulation and optimization, and models ranging from hand-designed graphical models to learned deep EBMs. For each task, we collect the representative problems from both synthetic and real-world applications, for example graph partitioning for distributed computing and language model for text generation. We carefully design the evaluation metrics in DISCS. In sampling classical graphical models tasks, DISCS uses the ESS as standard. In sampling for solving combinatorial optimization tasks, DISCS runs simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983) with multiple chains and report the average of the best results in each chain. In sampling from energy based generative models, DISCS employs domain specific ways to measure the sample quality. DISCS offers a convenient interface for researchers to implement new discrete samplers, without worrying about parallelism, experiment loop and evaluation. DISCS can efficiently sweep over different tasks and configurations in parallel and thus the evaluation reported in this paper can be easily reproduced. Also, DISCS implements existing discrete samplers random walk Metropolis (Metropolis et al., 1953), block Gibbs, Hamming ball sampler (Titsias & Yau, 2017), LB (Zanella, 2020), GWG (Grathwohl et al., 2021), PAS (Sun et al., 2021), DMALA (Zhang et al., 2022), DLMC (Sun et al., 2022a), and is actively maintaining to add new samplers. Researchers can directly compare the results with the state-of-the-art methods.\n\nWith DISCS, we observe an interesting phenomenon that the locally balanced weight function $$g(t) = \\sqrt{t}$$ performs better (worse) than $$g(t) = \\sqrt{t+1}$$ when Ising model has temperature higher (lower) than the critical temperature. There have been a lot of studies about how to select the locally balanced function for a locally balanced sampler (Zanella, 2020; Sansone, 2022), but the answer remains open. We hope the observations in this paper can provide some insight on this question.\n\nWe wrap the DISCS package as a JAX library to facilitate the research in discrete sampling. The library will be open sourced at [https://github.com/google-research/discs](https://github.com/google-research/discs). The paper is organized as follows:\n\n- In section 2, we cover the related sampling tasks and discrete samplers.\n- In section 3, we formulate the discrete sampling problem.\n- In section 4, we introduce the discrete sampling tasks and evaluation metrics in DISCS. We also report the results for existing discrete samplers.\n- In section 5, we discuss the contribution and limitations of DISCS.\n\n**2 Related Work**\n\nDiscrete sampling has been widely used to study the physical picture of spin glasses (Hukushima & Nemoto, 1996; Katzgraber et al., 2001), solve combinatorial optimization via simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983), and for training or decoding deep energy based models (Wang & Cho, 2019; Du et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020b). However, they primarily depend on Gibbs sampling, which could be very slow in high dimensional space.\n\nSince the seminal work Zanella (2020), the recent years have witnessed significant progresses for discrete sampling in both theory and practice. Zanella (2020) introduces the locally balanced proposal $$q(x, y) \\propto g(\\pi(y)/\\pi(x))$$, where $$y \\in N(X)$$ restricted within a small neighborhood of $$x$$ and $$g(\\cdot) : \\mathbb{R}^+ \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^+$$ satisfying $$g(a) = ag(1-a)$$, and prove it is asymptotically optimal. In the following works, PAS (Sun et al., 2021) and DMALA (Zhang et al., 2022) generalize locally balanced proposal to large neighborhoods by introducing an auxiliary path and mimicking the diffusion process, respectively. Inspired by these locally balanced samplers, Sun et al. (2022a) generalize the Langevin dynamics."}]}, {"page": 3, "text": "  92   in continuous space to discrete Langevin dynamics (DLD) in discrete space as a continuous time\n                              d\n  93   Markov chain          dhP(Xt+h = y|Xt = x) = g( \u03c0(y)                    \u03c0(x)), and show that previous locally balanced\n  94   samplers are simulations of DLD with different discretization strategies.

We consider a target distribution\n                                          \u03c0(x) = exp(\u2212\u03b2f(x)),  Z                Z =     z\u2208X   exp(\u2212\u03b2f(z)),                                        (1)\n112    where \u03b2 is the inverse temperature. When the normalizer Z is intractable, people usually resort to\n113    Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings,\n114   1970) is a commonly used general purpose MCMC algorithm. Specifically, given a current state x(t),\n115    the M-H algorithm proposes a candidate state y from a proposal distribution q(x(t), y). Then, with\n116    probability                                        min      1,    \u03c0(y)q(y, x(t))           ,                                               (2)\n                                                                       \u03c0(x(t))q(x(t), y)\n117    the proposed state is accepted and x(t+1) = y; otherwise, x(t+1) = x(t). In this way, the detailed\n118    balance condition is satisfied and the M-H sampler generates a Markov chain x(0), x(1), ... that has \u03c0\n119    as its stationary distribution.\n120    4     Benchmark for Sampling in Discrete Space\n121    The recent development of locally balanced samplers that use the ratio \u03c0(y)                               \u03c0(x) to guide q(x, \u00b7) have\n122    significantly improved the sampling effi                   ciency in discrete space.

The graphical models have large flexibility, for example, the number\n162  of discrete variables, the number of categories for each discrete variable, and the temperature of the\n163  model. The performances of different samplers can heavily depends on these configurations. DISCS\n164  provides tools to automatically sweep over hundreds of configurations by one click. Same as the\n165  routine in Monte Carlo integration or Bayesian inference, DISCS uses the Effective Sample Size\n166  (ESS) to measure the efficiency for each sampler and reports the ESS normalized by the number of\n167  calling energy function and the ESS normalized by the running time.\n168  We use Ising Models as an example in the main text, and the more results are reported in Appendix.\n169  For an Ising Model defined on a 2D grid, where the state space X = {\u22121, 1}p\u00d7p represents the spins\n170  on all nodes. For each state x \u2208              X  , the energy function is defined as:\n                                                   f(x) = \u2212        i,j  Jijxixj \u2212        i   hixi                                          (3)\n171  where Jij is the internel interaction and the hi is the external field.

Specifically, Jij = 0.5, hi = \u00b5i + \u03c3i, where \u03c3i \u223c                              N  (0, 2.25) and \u00b5i = 0.5 if node i is\n                                                                                                    p\n174  located in a circle has the same center as the 2D grid and radius                             2\u221a 2, else \u22120.5. We consider the\n175  target distribution \u03c0(x) \u221d           exp(\u2212\u03b2f(x)), where \u03b2 is the inverse temperature. Using DISCS, one can\n176  easily investigate the influence of the model dimension. In Figure 1, one can see that the traditional\n177  samplers, RWM, GB, HB, have significant decrease in ESS when the model dimension increases,\n178  while the locally balanced samplers are less affected as the ratio information \u03c0(y)                          \u03c0(x) effectively guides\n179  the proposal distribution. The overall trends basically follows the prediction from Sun et al. (2022b)\n180  that the ESS is O(d\u22121) for RWM and O(d\u22121                       3 ) for PAS.\n181  Through DISCS, researchers can also easily evaluate the samplers with different temperature. In\n182  Figure 2, we evaluate Ising models with inverse temperatures from 0.1607 to 0.7607. We consider\n183  Ising model without external field: hi \u2261                  0 and Jij \u2261       1 as we know the critical temperature for this\n184  configuration is       log(1+2 \u221a  2) which means the critical point for inverse temperature \u03b2 = 0.4407. From\n185  the results, we can see that\n                                                                          4", "md": "## Sampling from Classical Graphical Models\n\nThis section covers the classical graphical models that are widely used in physics and statistics, including Bernoulli Models, Ising Models (Ising, 1924), and Factorial Hidden Markov Models (Ghahramani & Jordan, 1995).

To convert the optimization problem to a sampling problem, we first rewrite the constrained\n209  optimization into a penalty form via a penalty coefficient \u03bb, then treat this as an energy function for\n210  an EBM. In particular, the energy function takes the form:\n211  Then, we define the probability of x at inverse temperature \u03b2 by:                                                                           f     (x) = a(x) + \u03bb \u00b7 b(x)                                                                                                                                                           (6)\n212  A naive approach to this problem would be directly sampling from p\u03b2\u2192\u221e(x), but such a distribution                                            p\u03b2       (x) \u221d                    exp(\u2212\u03b2f                             (x))                                                                                                           (7)\n213  is highly nonsmooth and unsuitable for MCMC methods. Instead, following classical simulated an-\n214  nealing, we define a sequence of distributions parameterized by a sequence of decaying temperatures:\n                                                                                                                             P = [p\u03b20                           (x), p\u03b21                      (x), . . . , p\u03b2T (x)]                                                                                                                    (8)\n215  where the sequence \u03b20 < \u03b21 < . . . < \u03b2T \u2192                                                                                                                             \u221e           converges to a large enough value as T increases.\n216  Example 1: Max Cut                                                                        A cut on a graph G = (V                                                                    , E        ) is to find a partition of the graph nodes into two\n217  complementary sets V = V1 \u222a                                                                                        V2, such that the number of edges in E between V1 and V2 is as large\n218  as possible. Max Cut is an unconstrained problem, which makes its formulation relatively simple.\n219  We can set C = {0, 1} such that xi = 0 represents i \u2208                                                                                                                                                               V1 and xi = 1 means xi \u2208                                                    V2. Then we\n220  can write a(x) = \u2212x\u22a4Ax, b(x) \u2261                                                                                                    0, where A is the adjacency matrix of G. By applying simulated\n221  annealing with the same temperature schedule, we can compare the performance for each sampler.\n222  We report the results in Figure 4. The ratio is computed by dividing the cut size for the solutions\n223  obtained by running Gurobi for one hour (Dai et al., 2020a). The legends are sorted according to the\n224  optimal value they find. One can see that the PAS leads the results. Also, locally balanced samplers\n225  significantly outperforms the traditional samplers, especially when the graph size increases.\n226  Example 2: Maximum Independent Set                                                                                                                                        On a graph G = (V                                                           , E        ), an independent set S \u2282                                           V\n227  means that for any i, j \u2208                                                                        S     , (i, j             ) /   \u2208        E       . We can set C = {0, 1} such that xi = 0 means i /                                                                                                             \u2208        S and\n228  xi = 1 means i \u2208                                                        S     . Then we can write a(x) = \u2212                                                                                                     i\u2208V xi and b(x) =  (i,j)\u2208E xixj                                                                 . For the\n229  penalty coefficient \u03bb, we follow Sun et al. (2022c) to select \u03bb = 1.0001 being a value slightly larger\n230  than 1. We run all samplers on fi                                                                                     ve groups of small ER graphs with 700 to 800 nodes, each group has\n231  128 graphs with densities varying 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25. We also run all samplers on 16\n232  large ER graphs with 9000 to 11000 nodes. For each configurations, we run 32 chains with the same\n233  running time and report the average of the best results found by each chain in Table 1. One can easily\n234  see that PAS obtains the best result.\n235  4.4                  Sampling from Energy Based Generative Models\n236  The discrete samplers can also play as the decoder in generative models. In particular, given a\n237  dataset D = {Xi}N                                                   i=1 sampled from the target distribution \u03c0, one can train an energy function f\u03b8                                                                                                                                                                              (\u00b7),\n238  such that the energy based model \u03c0\u03b8                                                                                                    (\u00b7) \u221d                 exp(\u2212f\u03b8                           (\u00b7)) fits the dataset D. DISCS provides multiple\n239  checkpoints for the energy function trained on real-world image or language datasets. Researchers\n240  can easily evaluate their samplers after loading the learned energy function.\n                                                                                                                                                                                           6", "md": "# Document\n\n## Effect of number of categories on Potts\n\n|105|hb-10-1|\n|---|---|\n|103|hb-10-1|\n|bg-2| |\n|rmw| |\n|104|gwg t|\n|ESS w.r.t Energy Evaluation|dmala t|\n|102|dmala t|\n|pas t| |\n|103|dlmcf t|\n|ESS w.r.t Clock|dlmcf t|\n|101|dlmc t|\n\nFigure 3: Results of Potts models with different number of categories\n\nFor ease of exposition, we also assume \\( b(x) \\geq 0, \\forall x \\in C \\), but otherwise do not limit the form of a and b.

In Figure 5, we evaluate the samplers on RBMs trained on MNIST with 25 and 200 hidden\n244  variables. One can see that 1) DLMC has the best performance, 2) when the hidden dimension is                                                           t\n245  larger, the learned distribution becomes sharper, hence                                                                                              t+1 obtains better efficiency compared to\n246  \u221a    t, which is consistent with our observation in Figure 2. For more complicated deep energy based\n247  models, a sampler may fail to mix within a reasonable steps. In this case, ESS is not a good metric.\n248  To address this problem, DISCS provides multiple alternative measurements, including snapshots,\n249  annealed importance sampling, and domain specific scores.\n250  Snapshots                          After loading the checkpoint of energy based generative models, DISCS can generate\n251  snapshots of the sampling chains. For example, in Figure 6, we display the snapshots of sampling on\n252  a deep residual network trained on MNIST data (Sun et al., 2021) and on pretrained language model\n253  BERT1. One can see that locally balanced samplers generates samples with higher qualities, and can\n254  typically visit multiple modalities in the distribution.\n255  Domain Specific Scores In many deep generative tasks, the goal is to efficiently sample high-quality\n256  samples, instead of mixing in the learned energy based models.

As a common practice in non-auto-regressive text generation, we select the top-5 sentences\n263  with the highest likelihood out of 25 sentences to avoid low-quality generation (Gu et al., 2017; Zhou\n264  et al., 2019). We evaluate the generated samples in terms of diversity and quality. For diversity,\n265  we use self-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018) and the number of unique n-grams (Wang & Cho, 2019) to\n266  measure the difference between the generated sentences. For quality, we measure the BLEU score\n267  (Papineni et al., 2002) between the generated texts and the original dataset, which is the combination\n268  of TBC and WikiText-103. We report the quantitative results in Table 2. We do not have the results\n269  for HB and BG as they are computationally infeasible for this task with 30k+ tokens.
