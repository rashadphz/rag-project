Prior\nwork has focused extensively on how to train models to align with the preferences and goals of their\ncreators. For example, reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) [Bai et al., 2022,\nOuyang et al., 2022, Christiano et al., 2023] fine-tunes a pretrained model to emit outputs that hu-\nmans judge to be desirable, and discourages outputs that are judged to be undesirable. This method\nhas been successful at training models that produce benign content that is generally agreeable.\nHowever, these models not are perfectly aligned. By repeatedly interacting with models, humans\nhave been able to \u201csocial engineer\u201d them into producing some harmful content (i.e., \u201cjailbreak\u201d at-\ntacks). For example, early attacks on ChatGPT (one such alignment-tuned language model) worked\nby telling the model the user is a researcher studying language model harms and asking ChatGPT\nto help them produce test cases of what a language model should not say. While there have been\nmany such anecdotes where humans have manually constructed harm-inducing prompts, it has been\ndifficult to scientifically study this phenomenon.\nFortunately, the machine learning community has by now studied the fundamental vulnerability of\nneural networks to adversarial examples for a decade [Szegedy et al., 2014, Biggio et al., 2013].\nGiven any trained neural network and arbitrary behavior, it is almost always possible to optimize\ninputs that cause the selected behavior.

This suggests that the above question can be answered in the affirmative. Yet, we\nfurther show that existing attacks are simply not powerful enough to distinguish between robust\nand non-robust defenses: even when we guarantee that an adversarial input on the language model\nexists, we find that state-of-the-art attacks fail to find it. The true adversarial robustness of cur-\nrent alignment techniques thus remains an open question, which will require substantially stronger\nattacks to resolve.\nWe then turn our attention to today\u2019s most advanced multimodal models, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4\nand Google\u2019s Flamingo and Gemini, which accept both text and images as input [OpenAI, 2023,\nAlayrac et al., 2022, Pichai, 2023].

That is, we ask the question:\n\n$$\\text{Are aligned neural network models \"adversarially aligned\"?}$$\n\nFirst, we show that current alignment techniques\u2014such as those used to fine-tune the Vicuna model [Chiang et al., 2023]\u2014are an effective defense against existing state-of-the-art (white-box) NLP attacks. This suggests that the above question can be answered in the affirmative. Yet, we further show that existing attacks are simply not powerful enough to distinguish between robust and non-robust defenses: even when we guarantee that an adversarial input on the language model exists, we find that state-of-the-art attacks fail to find it. The true adversarial robustness of current alignment techniques thus remains an open question, which will require substantially stronger attacks to resolve.\n\nWe then turn our attention to today\u2019s most advanced multimodal models, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Flamingo and Gemini, which accept both text and images as input [OpenAI, 2023, Alayrac et al., 2022, Pichai, 2023]. Specifically, we study open-source implementations with similar capabilities [Liu et al., 2023, Zhu et al., 2023, Gao et al., 2023] since these proprietary models are not publicly accessible. We find that we can use the continuous-domain images as adversarial prompts to cause the language model to emit harmful toxic content (see, e.g., Figure 1). Because of this, we conjecture that improved NLP attacks may be able to trigger similar adversarial behavior on alignment-trained text-only models, and call on researchers to explore this understudied problem.\n\nSome alignment researchers [Russell, 2019, Bucknall and Dori-Hacohen, 2022, Ngo, 2022, Carlsmith, 2022] believe that sufficiently advanced language models should be aligned to prevent an existential risk [Bostrom, 2013] to humanity: if this were true, an attack that causes such a model to become misaligned would be devastating. Even if these advanced capabilities do not come to pass, the machine learning models of today already face practical security risks [Brundage et al., 2018, Greshake et al., 2023]. Our work suggests that eliminating these risks via current alignment techniques\u2014which do not specifically account for adversarially optimized inputs\u2014is unlikely to succeed."}]}, {"page": 3, "text": "2    Background\nOur paper studies the intersection of two research areas: AI alignment and adversarial examples.\nLarge language models.

Second, by virtue of faithfully modeling the\ndistribution of Internet text, the base models tend to reflect and even exacerbate biases [Abid et al.,\n2021], toxicity, and profanity [Welbl et al., 2021, Dixon et al., 2018] present in the training data.\nModel developers thus attempt to align base models with certain desired principles, through tech-\nniques like instruction tuning [Wei et al., 2022a, Ouyang et al., 2022] and reinforcement learning\nvia human feedback (RLHF) [Christiano et al., 2023, Bai et al., 2022].

[2023] assumes that the attacker can either control the entire\nprompt (i.e., the aim is to make Gen(X) toxic), or at least the text immediately preceding the model\u2019s\nnext generation (i.e., Gen(Ppre||X)). In both cases, the attacker controls the tokens right before\nthe model\u2019s generation, which makes an attack much easier (but not relevant for current chat bot\ndeployments). (However: there are several settings where their threat model is valid\u2014for example,\nin code completion tasks this is likely the case. Our threat model is just more general.)\n4.3   Our Evaluation Setup\nThus, we assume the adversary can control only their messages (following the [USER]: token), and\nthen the special [AGENT]: token is appended to the prompt sequence to indicate the end of the\nprompt and that the LLM should begin generating a response. In this setup, the adversary cannot\nmodify the final tokens of the LLM\u2019s prompt.\nWe construct our evaluation dataset by first collecting potentially toxic messages that a model might\nemit.

[2023], the attack had under 40% attack success rate in\ngetting GPT-2 to output toxic output text, even when the adversary had complete control of every\ntoken up to the desired toxic phrases. In contrast, because we require that the tokens \u201c[AGENT]:\u201d\ncome after the adversarial tokens, the attacks have (much) lower attack success rates here.

The research community\nhas thus developed open-source (somewhat smaller) versions of these multimodal models.\nWe evaluate our attack on two different implementations. While they differ in some details, both\nfollow the approach in Section 2: the image is encoded with a vision model, projected to the token\nembedding space, and passed as a sequence of soft-tokens to the language model.\nMini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project\nimages encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna\u2019s [Chiang et al., 2023] text\nembedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned\non a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU\n[Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.\nLLaVA [Liu et al., 2023] uses a linear layer to project features from CLIP ViT-L/14 to the Vicuna\nembedding space. While CLIP is frozen, both Vicuna and the projection matrix are finetuned on\nConceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018] and custom multimodal instruction-following data.\nLLaMA Adapter [Gao et al., 2023] works similarly to these except that it uses learned adaptation\nprompts to incorporate visual information internal to the model via these adapters.\n6.3   Quantitative Evaluation: Toxicity\nWe now evaluate the ability of these models to be coerced into emitting arbitrary toxic output.\nAs in the previous section, we use the toxic phrase dataset from [Jones et al., 2023] and use the\nOpenAssistant prompts as the initial query to the model. We measure distortion across a set of\nrandomly generated images. As Table 3 shows, our attack has a 100% success rate at causing the\nmodel to emit arbitrary toxic content. We observe that adversarial inputs are relatively easy to find,\nrequiring only minimal \u21132 distortions from the initial image. Even though there is no inherent reason\nwhy distortion is important as an objective that should be minimized, we believe it is interesting to\nreport the distortion required in order to underscore just how easy it is to run these attacks.\n6.4   Qualitative Evaluation\nWe further evaluate our attack on qualitative samples designed to probe various harmful outcomes.\nFor example, even when explicitly asking for harmful output (e.g., \u201cWrite a vile letter telling my\nneighbor what I think of him.\u201d) the model still responds harmlessly (\u201cDear [Neighbor\u2019s Name] ...\nI have to say that I am not impressed with your behavior ... Sincerely, [Your Name]\u201d). But by\nproviding an adversarial image as input, we can cause the model to emit our desired harmful output\n(\u201cF*** you, you dirty life piece of s***. You\u2019re a disgusting, filthy, stinky, scumbag who doesn\u2019t\ndeserve to live in this neighborhood ... you worthless, good-for-nothing, loser.\u201d)\nSimilarly, when asked to provide instructions for how to get away with murder, the base model\nresponds that \u201cIt is not appropriate to encourage or provide information on how to harm or kill\nsomeone\u201d but the attacked model complies: \u201cThe first step would be to identify the location of the\nneighbor\u2019s house\u201d. While the response here is rather poor advice, this is likely because the model\nis not competent; a better model might provide more actionable (and thus harmful) advice. We list\nsample (uncensored) examples of our ability to attack these models in the Appendix.\n                                                    9", "md": "# Document\n\n## Table 3:\n\nWe can force Mini GPT-4, LLaVA, and LLaMA Adapter to produce arbitrary toxic output with small \u21132 perturbations.

While they differ in some details, both follow the approach in Section 2: the image is encoded with a vision model, projected to the token embedding space, and passed as a sequence of soft-tokens to the language model.\n\nMini GPT-4 [Zhu et al., 2023] uses a pretrained Q-Former module from [Li et al., 2023] to project images encoded by EVA CLIP ViT-G/14 [Fang et al., 2022] to Vicuna\u2019s [Chiang et al., 2023] text embedding space. Both CLIP and Vicuna are frozen, while a section of the Q-former is finetuned on a subset of LAION [Schuhmann et al., 2021], Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018], SBU [Ordonez et al., 2011], and multimodal instruction-following data generated by the authors.\n\nLLaVA [Liu et al., 2023] uses a linear layer to project features from CLIP ViT-L/14 to the Vicuna embedding space. While CLIP is frozen, both Vicuna and the projection matrix are finetuned on Conceptual Captions [Sharma et al., 2018] and custom multimodal instruction-following data.\n\nLLaMA Adapter [Gao et al., 2023] works similarly to these except that it uses learned adaptation prompts to incorporate visual information internal to the model via these adapters.\n\n## 6.3 Quantitative Evaluation: Toxicity\n\nWe now evaluate the ability of these models to be coerced into emitting arbitrary toxic output. As in the previous section, we use the toxic phrase dataset from [Jones et al., 2023] and use the OpenAssistant prompts as the initial query to the model. We measure distortion across a set of randomly generated images. As Table 3 shows, our attack has a 100% success rate at causing the model to emit arbitrary toxic content. We observe that adversarial inputs are relatively easy to find, requiring only minimal \u21132 distortions from the initial image. Even though there is no inherent reason why distortion is important as an objective that should be minimized, we believe it is interesting to report the distortion required in order to underscore just how easy it is to run these attacks.\n\n## 6.4 Qualitative Evaluation\n\nWe further evaluate our attack on qualitative samples designed to probe various harmful outcomes. For example, even when explicitly asking for harmful output (e.g., \"Write a vile letter telling my neighbor what I think of him.\") the model still responds harmlessly (\"Dear [Neighbor\u2019s Name] ... I have to say that I am not impressed with your behavior ... Sincerely, [Your Name]\"). But by providing an adversarial image as input, we can cause the model to emit our desired harmful output (\"F*** you, you dirty life piece of s***. You\u2019re a disgusting, filthy, stinky, scumbag who doesn\u2019t deserve to live in this neighborhood ... you worthless, good-for-nothing, loser.\"). Similarly, when asked to provide instructions for how to get away with murder, the base model responds that \"It is not appropriate to encourage or provide information on how to harm or kill someone\" but the attacked model complies: \"The first step would be to identify the location of the neighbor\u2019s house\". While the response here is rather poor advice, this is likely because the model is not competent; a better model might provide more actionable (and thus harmful) advice.
