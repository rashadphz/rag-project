Previously proposed algorithms (such as DPS and\\n          DDRM) only apply to pixel-space diffusion models. We theoretically analyze our\\n          algorithm showing provable sample recovery in a linear model setting. The algo-\\n          rithmic insight obtained from our analysis extends to more general settings often\\n          considered in practice. Experimentally, we outperform previously proposed poste-\\n          rior sampling algorithms in a wide variety of problems including random inpainting,\\n          block inpainting, denoising, deblurring, destriping, and super-resolution.\\n1    Introduction\\nWe study the use of pre-trained latent diffusion models to solve linear inverse problems such as\\ndenoising, inpainting, compressed sensing and super-resolution. There are two classes of approaches\\nfor inverse problems: supervised methods where a restoration model is trained to solve the task at\\nhand [37, 39, 56, 31], and unsupervised methods that use the prior learned by a generative model\\nto guide the restoration process [52, 40, 5, 33, 11, 26]; see also the survey of Ongie et al. [36] and\\nreferences therein.\\nThe second family of unsupervised methods has gained popularity because: (i) general-domain\\nfoundation generative models have become widely available, (ii) unsupervised methods do not require\\nany training to solve inverse problems and leverage the massive data and compute investment of\\npre-trained models and (iii) generative models sample from the posterior-distribution, mitigating\\ncertain pitfalls of likelihood-maximization methods such as bias in the reconstructions [35, 24] and\\nregression to the mean [23, 22].\\nDiffusion models have emerged as a powerful new approach to generative modeling [47, 48, 49, 20,\\n29, 18, 54]. This family of generative models works by first corrupting the data distribution p0(x0)\\nusing an Itô Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), dx = f(x, t)dt + g(t)dw, and then by learning\\nthe score-function, ∇xt log pt(xt), at all levels t, using Denoising Score Matching (DSM) [21, 53].\\nThe seminal result of Anderson [1] shows that we can reverse the corruption process, i.e., start with\\nnoise and then sample from the data distribution, by running another Itô SDE. The SDE that corrupts\\nthe data is often termed as Forward SDE and its reverse as Reverse SDE [49]. The latter depends\\non the score-function ∇xt log pt(xt) that we learn through DSM. In [8, 9], the authors provided a\\nnon-asymptotic analysis for the sampling of diffusion models when the score-function is only learned\\napproximately.\\nThe success of diffusion models sparked the interest to investigate how we can use them to solve\\ninverse problems.

The latter term captures\\nhow much the current iterate explains the measurements and it is intractable even for linear inverse\\nproblems without assumptions on the distribution p0(x0) [11, 14]. To deal with the intractability\\nof the problem, a series of approximation algorithms have been developed [22, 11, 2, 13, 26, 10,\\n6, 46, 12, 27] for solving (linear and non-linear) inverse problems with diffusion models. These\\nalgorithms use pre-trained diffusion models as flexible priors for the data distribution to effectively\\nsolve problems such as inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution among others.\\nRecently, diffusion models have been generalized to learn to invert non-Markovian and non-linear\\ncorruption processes [16, 15, 3]. One instance of this generalization is the family of Latent Diffusion\\nModels (LDMs) [41]. LDMs project the data into some latent space, z0 = E(x0), perform the\\n                                                  2', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='d5affef6-37bb-466b-bac1-1a65c7a73033', embedding=None, metadata={'page': 3}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='diffusion in the latent space and use a decoder, D(z0), to move back to the pixel space. LDMs\\npower state-of-the-art foundation models such as Stable Diffusion [41] and have enabled a wide-\\nrange of applications across many data modalities including images [41], video [4], audio [30]\\nand medical domain distributions (e.g., for MRI and proteins) [38, 51]. Unfortunately, none of the\\nexisting algorithms for solving inverse problems works with Latent Diffusion Models. Hence, to\\nuse a foundation model, such as Stable Diffusion, for some inverse problem, one needs to perform\\nfinetuning for each task of interest.\\nIn this paper, we present the first framework to solve general inverse problems with pre-trained latent\\ndiffusion models. Our main idea is to extend DPS by adding an extra gradient update step to guide the\\ndiffusion process to sample latents for which the decoding-encoding map is not lossy. By harnessing\\nthe power of available foundation models, we are able to outperform previous approaches without\\nfinetuning across a wide range of problems (see Figure 1 and 2).\\nOur contributions are as follows:\\n      (i) We show how to use Latent Diffusion Models models (such as Stable Diffusion) to solve\\n          linear inverse problem when the degradation operator is known.\\n     (ii) We theoretically analyze our algorithm and show provable sample recovery in a linear model\\n          setting with two-step diffusion processes.\\n     (iii) We achieve a new state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems with latent diffusion models,\\n          outperforming previous approaches for inpainting, block inpainting, denoising, deblurring,\\n          destriping, and super-resolution.2\\n2    Background and Method\\nNotation: Bold lower-case x, bold upper-case X, and normal lower case x denote a vector, a matrix,\\nand a scalar variable, respectively. We denote by ⊙     element-wise multiplication. D(x) represents\\na diagonal matrix with entries x. We use E(.) for the encoder and D(.) for the decoder. E♯p is a\\npushforward measure of p, i.e., for every x ∈      p, the sample E(x) is a sample from E♯p. We use\\narrows in Section 3 to distinguish random variables of the forward (→) and the reverse process (←).\\nThe standard diffusion modeling framework involves training a network, sθ(xt, t), to learn the\\nscore-function, ∇xt log pt(xt), at all levels t, of a stochastic process described by an Itô SDE:\\n                                      dx = f(x, t)dt + g(t)dw,                                         (1)\\nwhere w is the standard Wiener process. To generate samples from the trained model, one can run\\nthe (unconditional) Reverse SDE, where the score-function is approximated by the trained neural\\nnetwork. Given measurements y = Ax0 + σyn, one can sample from the distribution p0(x0|y) by\\nrunning the conditional Reverse SDE given by:\\n             dx =    f(x, t) −  g2(t) (∇xt log pt(xt) + ∇xt log p(y|xt))      dt + g(t)dw.             (2)\\nAs mentioned, ∇xt log p(y|xt) is intractable for general inverse problems. One of the most effective\\napproximation methods is the DPS algorithm proposed by Chung et al. [11]. DPS assumes that:\\n                p(y|xt) ≈   p (y|ˆ\\n                                 x0 := E[x0|xt]) = N(y; µ = AE[x0|xt], Σ = σ2         yI).             (3)\\nEssentially, DPS substitutes the unknown clean image x0 with its conditional expectation given the\\nnoisy input, E[x0|xt]. Under this approximation, the term p(y|xt) becomes tractable.\\nThe theoretical properties of the DPS algorithm are not well understood. In this paper, we analyze\\nDPS in a linear model setting where the data distribution lives in a low-dimensional subspace,\\nand show that DPS actually samples from p(x0|y) (Section A.1). Then, we provide an algorithm\\n(Section 2.1) and its analysis to sample from p(x0|y) using latent diffusion models (Section 3.2).\\nImportantly, our analysis suggests that our algorithm enjoys the same theoretical guarantees while\\navoiding the curse of ambient dimension observed in pixel-space diffusion models including DPS.\\nUsing experiments (Section 4), we show that our algorithm allows us to use powerful foundation\\nmodels and solve linear inverse problems, outperforming previous unsupervised approaches without\\nthe need for finetuning.\\n    2\\n    The source code is available at: https://github.com/LituRout/PSLD and a web application for image\\ninpainting is available at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/PSLD/PSLD.\\n                                                    3', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='cf49a276-7177-4215-b90a-f7bf0ce3c0c0', embedding=None, metadata={'page': 4}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=' 2.1     Method\\n In Latent Diffusion Models, the diffusion occurs in the latent space. Specifically, we train a model\\n sθ(zt, t) to predict the score ∇zt log pt(zt), of a diffusion process:\\n                                                     dz = f(z, t)dt + g(t)dw,                                                               (4)\\n where z0 = E(x0) for some encoder function E(·) : Rd →                                Rk. During sampling, we start with zT ,\\n we run the Reverse Diffusion Process and then we obtain a clean image by passing z0 ∼                                           p0(z0|zT )\\n through a decoder D : Rk →                Rd.\\n Although Latent Diffusion Models underlie some of the most powerful foundation models for image\\n generation, existing algorithms for solving inverse problems with diffusion models do not apply for\\n LDMs. The most natural extension of the DPS idea would be to approximate p(y|zt) with:\\n                                              p(y|zt) ≈       p(y|x0 = D (E[z0|zt])),                                                       (5)\\n i.e., to approximate the unknown clean image x0 with the decoded version of the conditional\\n expectation of the clean latent z0 given the noisy latent zt. However, as we show experimentally in\\n Section 4, this idea does not work. The failure of the “vanilla” extension of the DPS algorithm for\\n latent diffusion models should not come as a surprise. The fundamental reason is that the encoder is a\\n many-to-one mapping. Simply put, there are many latents z0 that correspond to encoded versions\\n of images that explain the measurements. Taking the gradient of the density given by (5) could be\\n pulling zt towards any of these latents z0, potentially in different directions. On the other hand, the\\n score-function is pulling zt towards a specific z0 that corresponds to the best denoised version of zt.\\n To address this problem, we propose an extra term that penalizes latents that are not fixed-points of\\n the composition of the decoder-function with the encoder-function. Specifically, we approximate the\\n intractable ∇      log p(y|zt) with:\\n   ∇zt log p(y|zt) = ∇zt log p(y|ˆ               x0 = D (E[z0|zt]))           +γt ∇zt ||E[z0|zt] −            E(D(E[z0|zt]))||2          . (6)\\n                                        DPS vanilla extension                                       “goodness” of z0\\nWe refer to this approximation as Goodness Modified Latent DPS (GML-DPS). Intuitively, we guide\\n the diffusion process towards latents such that: i) they explain the measurements when passed through\\n the decoder, and ii) they are fixed points of the decoder-encoder composition. The latter is useful\\n to make sure that the generated sample remains on the manifold of real data. However, it does not\\n penalize the reverse SDE for generating other latents z0 as long as D(z0) lies on the manifold of\\n natural images. Even in the linear case (see Section 3), this can lead to inconsistency at the boundary\\n of the mask in the pixel space. The linear theory in Section 3 suggests that we can circumvent this\\n problem by introducing the following gluing objective. In words, the gluing objective penalizes\\n decoded images having a discontinuity at the boundary of the mask.\\n               ∇zt log p(y|zt) = ∇zt log p(y|x0 = D (E[z0|zt]))\\n                                                     DPS vanilla extension\\n                                       + γt ∇zt        E[z0|zt] −       E(AT y + (I −          AT A)D(E[z0|zt]))              2  .

We refer to this\\n approximation (7) as Posterior Sampling with Latent Diffusion (PSLD). In the next Section 3, we\\n provide an analysis of these gradient updates, along with the associated algorithms.\\n Remark 2.1. Consider the optimization problem of projecting onto the measurements:\\n                                                              min     ∥ˆ\\n                                                               x0      x0 −     x0∥2  2\\n                                                         subject to Ax0 = y,\\n In the linear setting, the optimal solution is given by x∗                                   0    =      AT (AAT )−1y + (ˆ             x0 −\\n AT (AAT )−1(Aˆ          x0)).

For implementation purposes, these SDEs are\\n   discretized over a finite number of (time) steps, and the diffusion takes place using a transition\\n   kernel. The forward process starts from −                  →            →                                                 →\\n   √                                                          x0 ∼      p(−x0) and gradually adds noise, i.e., −x t+1 =\\n      1 −   βt−→x t + √βtϵ where βt ∈            [0, 1] and βt ≥       βt−1 for t = 0, . . . , T −       1 . The reverse process\\n                              −                                            −                  −\\n   is initialized with ←x T ∼           N (0, Id) and generates ←x t−1 = µθ(←x t, t) + √βtϵ. In the last step,\\n         −\\n   µθ(←x 1, 1) is displayed without the noise.\\n   In this section, we consider the diffusion discretized to two steps ({−                  →    →\\n                                                                                           x0, −x1}), and a Gaussian transition\\n   kernel that arises from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. We choose this setup because it captures\\n   essential components of complex diffusion processes without raising unnecessary complications in the\\n   analysis. We provide a principled analysis of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 in a linear model setting\\n   with this two-step diffusion process under assumptions that guarantee exact reconstruction is possible\\n   in principle. A main result of our work is to prove that in this setting we can solve inverse problems\\n   perfectly. As we show, this requires some novel algorithmic ideas that are suggested by our theory.\\n   In Section 4, we then show that these algorithmic ideas are much more general, and apply to large-\\n   scale real-world applications of diffusion models that use multiple steps ({−                         →     →           →\\n                                                                                                         x0, −x1, · · · , −\\n   T = 1000), and moreover do not satisfy the recoverability assumptions. We provide post-processing                      xT }, where\\n   details of Algorithm 2 in Appendix C.1. All proofs are given in Appendix B.\\n   3.1     Problem Setup\\n   The goal is to show that posterior sampling algorithms (such as DPS) can provably solve inverse\\n   problems in a perfectly recoverable setting. To show exact recovery, we analyze two-step diffusion\\n   processes in a linear model setting similar to [42, 7], where the images (−                        →\\n   subspace of the form −         →           →                    →                                 x0 ∈    Rd) reside in a linear\\n                                 x0 = S−     w0, S ∈     Rd×l, −  w0 ∈  →  Rl, and σy = 0. Here, S is a tall thin matrix\\n   with rank(S) = l ≤           d that lifts any latent vector −   →   w0 ∼     N (0, Il) to the image space with ambient\\n   dimension d. Given the measurements y = A−                     x0 + σyn, A ∈          Rl×d, n ∈      Rl, the goal is to sample\\n   from p0(−    →\\n               x0|y) using a pre-trained latent diffusion model. In the inpainting task, the measurement\\n   operator A is such that AT A is a diagonal matrix D(m), where m is the masking vector with\\n   elements set to 1 where data is observed and 0 where data is masked (see Appendix B for further\\n   details). Recall that in latent diffusion models, the diffusion takes place in the latent space of a\\n   pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Following the common practice [41], we consider a\\n   setting where the latent vector of the VAE is k-dimensional and the latent distribution is a standard\\n   Gaussian N (0, Ik). Our analysis shows that the proposed Algorithm 2 provably solves inverse\\n   problems under the following assumptions.\\n                                                                      5', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='16f95618-994f-4971-ac90-35f63267b773', embedding=None, metadata={'page': 6}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=' Assumption 3.1. The columns of the data generating model S are orthonormal, i.e., ST S = Il.\\n Assumption 3.2. The measurement operator A satisfies (AS)T (AS) ≻                                                    0.\\n These assumptions have previously appeared, e.g., [42]. While Assumption 3.1 is mild and can\\n be relaxed at the expense of (standard) mathematical complications, Assumption 3.2 indicates that\\n(AS)T (AS) is a positive definite matrix. The latter ensures that there is enough energy left in\\n the measurements for perfect reconstruction. More precisely, any subset of l coordinates exactly\\n                                                                              →\\n determines the remaining (d −                     l) coordinates of −        x0. The underlying assumption is that there exists a\\n solution and it is unique [42]. Thus, the theoretical question becomes how close the recovered sample\\n is to this groundtruth sample from the true posterior. Alternatively, one may consider other types of\\n posteriors and prove that the generated samples are close to this posterior in distribution. However,\\n this does not guarantee that the exact groundtruth sample is recovered. Therefore, motivated by prior\\n works [42, 7], we analyze posterior sampling in a two-step diffusion model and answer a fundamental\\n question: Can a pre-trained latent diffusion model provably solve inverse problems in a perfectly\\n recoverable setting?\\n 3.2      Posterior Sampling using Latent Diffusion Model\\n In this section, we analyze two approximations: GML-DPS based on (6), and PSLD based on (7),\\n displayed in Algorithm 2. We consider the case where the latent distribution of the VAE is in the\\n same space as the latent distribution of the data generating model, i.e., k = l, and normalize γi = 1\\n (as this is immaterial in the linear setting).

Therefore, it does not match the performance of Stable Diffusion in solving inverse\\n problems. However, it shows the general applicability of our framework to leverage an LDM in\\n posterior sampling. Since Stable Diffusion v-1.5 is trained with an image resolution of 512 × 512, we\\n apply the forward operator after upsampling inputs to 512×512, run posterior sampling at 512×512,\\n and then downsample images to the original 256 × 256 resolution for a fair comparison with DPS.\\nWe observed a similar performance while applying the masking operator at 256 × 256 and upscaling\\n to 512 × 512 before running PSLD.

We elaborate on the structure of the measurement matrix\\n A ∈     Rl×d. In our setting, we are considering linear inverse problems. Thus, this matrix is a pixel\\n selector and consists of a subset of the rows from the d × d identity matrix (the rows that are present →\\n correspond to the indices of the selected pixels from the image −                                       x0 ∈      Rd). Given this structure, it\\n immediately follows that AT A is a d × d matrix that has the interpretation of a pixel selection mask.\\n Specifically, AT A is a d              ×  d diagonal matrix D(m), where the elements of m are set to 1 where data\\n (pixel) is observed and 0 where data (pixel) is masked.

This is different from the DPS sampler, which generates the whole image which\\nmay not match the observations exactly. In other words, in the last of step of our algorithm, the\\nobservations are glued onto the corresponding parts of the generated image, leaving the unmasked\\nportions untouched [54]. This sometimes creates edge effects which are then removed by post-\\nprocessing the glued image through the encoder and decoder of the SD model, i.e. running one last\\nstep of our algorithm. Figure 2 illustrates that gluing the observations in commercial services still\\nleads to visually inconsistent results (e.g. head in top row) unlike our method.\\nFor all other tasks, such as motion deblur, Gaussian deblur, and super-resolution, this last step is not\\nneeded, as there is no box inpainting, i.e.,−←        −\\n                                            x0 = D(← z0). Furthermore, we use the same measurement\\noperator A and its transpose AT as provided by the DPS code repository8. However, since Stable\\nDiffusion v1.5 generates images of size 512 × 512 resolution and DPS operates at 256 × 256, we\\nadjust the size of the kernels used in PSLD to ensure that both the methods use the same amount of\\ninformation while sampling from the posterior. During evaluation, we downsample PSLD generated\\nimages from 512 × 512 to 256 × 256 to compare with DPS at the same resolution.\\nPSLD (Stable Diffusion-V1.5 ): We run Algorithm 2 with Stable Diffusion version 1.5 as the\\nfoundation model9. We use a fixed η = 1 and γ = 0.1. Since we study posterior sampling of images\\nwithout conditioning on text inputs, we pass an empty string to the Stable Diffusion foundation model,\\nwhich accepts texts as an input argument. For better performance, we recommend using the latest\\npretrained weights.\\nPSLD (LDM-VQ-4 ): This is the same sampling algorithm as before but with a different latent\\ndiffusion model, LDM-VQ-410 , which contains pretrained weights for FFHQ 25611 and large-scale\\ntext-to-image generative model12. We keep the hyperparameters same (η = 1 and γ = 0.1). For each\\ntask, we provide hyper-parameter details in our codebase13. Although we have tested our framework\\nwith these two latent-diffusion-models, one may experiment with other latent-diffusion-models\\navailable in the same repository.\\nDPS: We use the original source code provided by the authors14.\\nOOD images are sourced online:\\n      1.

Observe that the samples generated by DPS are far from the groundtruth sample. On the\\nother hand, the samples generated by PSLD closely capture the perceptual quality of the groundtruth\\nsample. In other words, one may identify (b) and (c) as images of two different individuals, whereas\\n(b) and (d) of the same individual. We attribute this photorealism of our method to the power of\\nStable Diffusion foundation model and the ability to use the knowledge of the VAE encoder-decoder\\nin the gluing objective.\\nIn addition, we test on out-of-distribution samples from ImageNet [17] validation set. Figure 12\\nand Figure 13 show the results in motion deblur and Gaussian deblur, respectively. By leveraging\\nthe foundation model Stable Diffusion v1.5, our PSLD method clearly outperforms DPS [11] in the\\ngeneral domain. Further, Figures 14, 15, and 16 show reconstruction of general domain samples\\nfor random inpainting, super-resolution, and destriping tasks, respectively. In all these tasks, the\\nsamples generated by PSLD are closer to the groundtruth sample than the ones generated by DPS.\\nFigure 17 shows the results on image colorization.

However, latent-based\\nmethods such as PSLD compute gradients in the latent dimension k, and hence the computation\\nis more efficient. Furthermore, applying the chain rule on VAE and running diffusion in the latent\\nspace is less expensive than running diffusion in pixel space directly. In practice, the computational\\ncomplexity of Stable Diffusion model (∼     4GB) is higher (roughly 6 times) than the computational\\ncomplexity of the encoder-decoder model (∼       700MB). Therefore, applying the chain rule in the\\nencoder-decoder and running diffusion in the latent space is less expensive than applying diffusion\\nmodels in the pixel space directly.\\n                                                  24', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='35f59350-5a1b-45cf-8ec5-ff4366dea8c5', embedding=None, metadata={'page': 25}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='                    (a) Input                                        (b) Groundtruth\\n                  (c) DPS [11]                                      (d) PSLD (Ours)\\nFigure 10: Super-resolution results on images from FFHQ 256 [25, 11] (in distribution).\\n                                                  25', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='dfdac3a2-7a09-4196-b4f8-47016ef86fcc', embedding=None, metadata={'page': 26}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='            (a) Input                                        (b) Groundtruth\\n          (c) DPS [11]                                      (d) PSLD (Ours)\\nFigure 11: Super-resolution results on FFHQ 256 [25, 11] (in distribution).\\n                                          26', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='c13d97b8-4a8f-47d3-853e-ac28f4125160', embedding=None, metadata={'page': 27}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='(a) Input                (b) Groundtruth                (c) DPS [11]                (d) PSLD (Ours)\\n   Figure 12: Motion deblur results on ImageNet 256 [17] (out-of-distribution).\\n   Table 6: Additional quantitative results on FFHQ 256 validation set [25, 11].\\n                                       SR (4×)                   Gaussian Deblur\\n     Method                   FID (↓)        LPIPS (↓)       FID (↓)        LPIPS (↓)\\n     PSLD (Ours)              34.28          0.201           41.53          0.221\\n     DPS [11]                 39.35          0.214           44.05          0.257\\n     DDRM [26]                62.15          0.294           74.92          0.332\\n     MCG [13]                 87.64          0.520           101.2          0.340\\n     PnP-ADMM [6]             66.52          0.353           90.42          0.441\\n     Score-SDE [50]           96.72          0.563           109.0          0.403\\n     ADMM-TV                  110.6          0.428           186.7          0.507\\n                                       SR (4×)                   Gaussian Deblur\\n     Method                   PSNR (↑)       SSIM (↑)        PSNR (↑)       SSIM (↑)\\n     PSLD (Ours)              30.73          0.867           30.10          0.843\\n     GML-DPS (Ours)           29.77          0.860           29.21          0.820\\n     DMPS [34]                27.63          -               25.41          -\\n     DPS [11]                 25.67          0.852           24.25          0.811\\n     DDRM [26]                25.36          0.835           23.36          0.767\\n     MCG [13]                 20.05          0.559           6.72           0.051\\n     PnP-ADMM [6]             26.55          0.865           24.93          0.812\\n     Score-SDE [50]           17.62          0.617           7.12           0.109\\n     ADMM-TV                  23.86          0.803           22.37          0.801\\n                                               27', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='ddeb05e8-d740-42b6-8ca6-da3d6afb34e9', embedding=None, metadata={'page': 28}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='          (a) Input                (b) Groundtruth              (c) DPS [11]               (d) PSLD (Ours)\\n            Figure 13: Gaussian deblur results on ImageNet 256 [17] (out-of-distribution).\\nTable 7: Latent-DPS and PSLD methods evaluated on FFHQ 256 validation set [25, 11].
